# MD007 - Unordered list indentation

Tags: bullet, ul, indentation

Aliases: ul-indent

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

Parameters: indent, start_indented, start_indent (number; default 2, boolean; default false, number; defaults to indent)

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

Fixable: Most violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered when list items are not indented by the configured
number of spaces (default: 2).

Example:

```markdown
* List item
   * Nested list item indented by 3 spaces
```

Corrected Example:

```markdown
* List item
  * Nested list item indented by 2 spaces
```

Note: This rule applies to a sublist only if its parent lists are all also
unordered (otherwise, extra indentation of ordered lists interferes with the
rule).

The `start_indented` parameter allows the first level of lists to be indented by
the configured number of spaces rather than starting at zero (the inverse of
MD006). The `start_indent` parameter allows the first level of lists to be indented
by a different number of spaces than the rest (ignored when `start_indented` is not
set).

Rationale: Indenting by 2 spaces allows the content of a nested list to be in
line with the start of the content of the parent list when a single space is
used after the list marker. Indenting by 4 spaces is consistent with code blocks
and simpler for editors to implement. Additionally, this can be a compatibility
issue for other Markdown parsers, which require 4-space indents. More information:
