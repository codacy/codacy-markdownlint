# MD010 - Hard tabs

Tags: whitespace, hard_tab

Aliases: no-hard-tabs

Parameters: code_blocks (boolean; default true)

Fixable: Most violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered by any lines that contain hard tab characters instead
of using spaces for indentation. To fix this, replace any hard tab characters
with spaces instead.

Example:

<!-- markdownlint-disable no-hard-tabs -->

```markdown
Some text

    * hard tab character used to indent the list item
```

<!-- markdownlint-restore -->

Corrected example:

```markdown
Some text

    * Spaces used to indent the list item instead
```

You have the option to exclude this rule for code blocks. To do so, set the
`code_blocks` parameter to `false`. Code blocks are included by default since
handling of tabs by tools is often inconsistent (ex: using 4 vs. 8 spaces).

Rationale: Hard tabs are often rendered inconsistently by different editors and
can be harder to work with than spaces.
