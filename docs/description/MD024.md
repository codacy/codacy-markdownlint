# MD024 - Multiple headings with the same content

Tags: headings, headers

Aliases: no-duplicate-heading, no-duplicate-header

Parameters: siblings_only, allow_different_nesting (boolean; default `false`)

This rule is triggered if there are multiple headings in the document that have
the same text:

```markdown
# Some text

## Some text
```

To fix this, ensure that the content of each heading is different:

```markdown
# Some text

## Some more text
```

If the parameter `siblings_only` (alternatively `allow_different_nesting`) is
set to `true`, heading duplication is allowed for non-sibling headings (common
in changelogs):

```markdown
# Change log

## 1.0.0

### Features

## 2.0.0

### Features
```

Rationale: Some markdown parsers generate anchors for headings based on the
heading name; headings with the same content can cause problems with that.
