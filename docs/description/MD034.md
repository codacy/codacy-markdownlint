# MD034 - Bare URL used

Tags: links, url

Aliases: no-bare-urls

Fixable: Most violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered whenever a URL is given that isn't surrounded by angle
brackets:

```markdown
For more information, see https://www.example.com/.
```

To fix this, add angle brackets around the URL:

```markdown
For more information, see <https://www.example.com/>.
```

Note: To use a bare URL without it being converted into a link, enclose it in
a code block, otherwise in some markdown parsers it _will_ be converted:

```markdown
`https://www.example.com`
```

Note: The following scenario does _not_ trigger this rule to avoid conflicts
with `MD011`/`no-reversed-links`:

```markdown
[https://www.example.com]
```

The use of quotes around a bare link will _not_ trigger this rule, either:

```markdown
"https://www.example.com"
'https://www.example.com'
```

Rationale: Without angle brackets, the URL isn't converted into a link by many
markdown parsers.
