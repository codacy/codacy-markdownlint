# MD038 - Spaces inside code span elements

Tags: whitespace, code

Aliases: no-space-in-code

Fixable: Most violations can be fixed by tooling

This rule is triggered for code span elements that have spaces adjacent to the
backticks:

```markdown
`some text `

` some text`
```

To fix this, remove any spaces adjacent to the backticks:

```markdown
`some text`
```

Note: A single leading and trailing space is allowed by the specification and
automatically trimmed (to allow for embedded backticks):

```markdown
`` `backticks` ``
```

Note: A single leading or trailing space is allowed if used to separate code span
markers from an embedded backtick:

```markdown
`` ` embedded backtick``
```

Rationale: Violations of this rule can lead to improperly rendered content.
