# MD043 - Required heading structure

Tags: headings, headers

Aliases: required-headings, required-headers

Parameters: headings, headers (array of string; default `null` for disabled)

> If `headings` is not provided, `headers` (deprecated) will be used.
This rule is triggered when the headings in a file do not match the array of
headings passed to the rule. It can be used to enforce a standard heading
structure for a set of files.

To require exactly the following structure:

```markdown
# Head
## Item
### Detail
```

Set the `headings` parameter to:

```json
[
    "# Head",
    "## Item",
    "### Detail"
]
```

To allow optional headings as with the following structure:

```markdown
# Head
## Item
### Detail (optional)
## Foot
### Notes (optional)
```

Use the special value `"*"` meaning "zero or more unspecified headings" or the
special value `"+"` meaning "one or more unspecified headings" and set the
`headings` parameter to:

```json
[
    "# Head",
    "## Item",
    "*",
    "## Foot",
    "*"
]
```

When an error is detected, this rule outputs the line number of the first
problematic heading (otherwise, it outputs the last line number of the file).

Note that while the `headings` parameter uses the "## Text" ATX heading style for
simplicity, a file may use any supported heading style.

Rationale: Projects may wish to enforce a consistent document structure across
a set of similar content.
